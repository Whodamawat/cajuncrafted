        <h2>Hi, I'm Jeremy!</h2>
        <p>I’m a Louisiana native who has found a new home—and a creative spark—in the heart of Pittsburgh. My work is a blend of craftsmanship and storytelling, combining custom woodworking with my passion for nature photography.
        <br>
        <br>
        From handcrafted furniture and one-of-a-kind home décor to custom picture frames and fine art prints, every piece I create is designed with care and intention. My photography captures the beauty of the natural world, and whether you’re looking for framed prints, digital downloads, or a custom-built frame for your own artwork, I offer pieces that bring warmth and character to any space.
        <br>
        <br>
        At the heart of it all is a love for the craft—transforming raw materials into something meaningful. Whether through wood, photography, or a combination of both, I strive to create work that tells a story and stands the test of time.</p>
