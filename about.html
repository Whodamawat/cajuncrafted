        <h2>Hello! Iâ€™m Jeremy</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m a Louisianian living in Pittsburgh with a passion for woodworking. Iâ€™m committed to design that exudes craftsmanship and beauty.</p>
        <h2>Let me tell you a bit about myself and how I got to where I am.</h2>
        <p>I was born & raised in the heart of Cajun country in rural South Louisiana. Iâ€™ve always been interested in building things, beginning with Legoâ€™s, Kinects, and Tinker Toys. When I was in college, I worked with my uncles gaining some construction experience. I really enjoyed working with my hands and having the rewarding feeling of seeing projects come to fruition. I thought nursing was my call, but eventually found out that I wasnâ€™t passionate about it, so I decided to hang up my stethoscope, switch my major so I could graduate, and try to figure out what to do with the rest of my lifeâ€¦<br>
        <br>
        Adventure was calling, so in February 2016 I began the 2189 mile thru-hike of the Appalachian trail, not realizing how much this experience would change my life. A few days into the hike I met my wife and after completing the trail together, I moved to Pittsburgh and we began building our new life together.<br>
        <br>
        I tried working for a few different companies, doing community outreach, coaching tennis and soccer at a local school, and even went back to school with the idea that I was going to stick to what I spent so long learning - healthcare. It was at that point that I began to realize that I just did not want to work in healthcare anymore.<br>
        <br>
        I wanted to build!<br>
        <br>
        I worked with a local construction company for a while and learned a lot about the trade as well as what I was most interested in - woodworking. The pandemic came around and I was laid off for a short while, giving me time to do more woodworking for fun and then I decided that I would use what I learned remodeling houses to start my own business.<br>
        <br>
        After spending about four years working for myself, primarily in construction, I felt the need for a change. I decided to transition into a completely different fieldâ€”tech. I applied to a program that allowed me to complete a tech bootcamp and gain on-the-job training as a business analyst. A year later, here I am, working as a business analyst for a local company while continuing to pursue my passions on the side.</p>
